    ABSTRACT={Traditional farming lifestyle has been shown to be protective against asthma and allergic diseases. The individual factors that appear to be associated with this “farm-life effect” include consumption of unpasteurized farm milk and exposure to farm animals and stables. However, the biomarkers of the protective immunity and those associated with early development of allergic diseases in infancy remain unclear. The “Zooming in to Old Order Mennonites (ZOOM)” study was designed to assess the differences in the lifestyle and the development of the microbiome, systemic and mucosal immunity between infants born to traditional farming lifestyle at low risk for allergic diseases and those born to urban/suburban atopic families with a high risk for allergic diseases in order to identify biomarkers of development of allergic diseases in infancy. 190 mothers and their infants born to Old Order Mennonite population protected from or in Rochester families at high risk for allergic diseases were recruited before birth from the Finger Lakes Region of New York State. Questionnaires and samples are collected from mothers during pregnancy and after delivery and from infants at birth and at 1–2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with 3-, 4-, and 5-year follow-up ongoing. Samples collected include maternal blood, stool, saliva, nasal and skin swabs and urine during pregnancy; breast milk postnatally; infant blood, stool, saliva, nasal and skin swabs. Signs and symptoms of allergic diseases are assessed at every visit and serum specific IgE is measured at 1 and 2 years of age. Allergic diseases are diagnosed by clinical history, exam, and sensitization by skin prick test and/or serum specific IgE. By the end of the first year of life, the prevalence of food allergy and atopic dermatitis were higher in ROC infants compared to the rates observed in OOM infants as was the number of infants sensitized to foods. These studies of immune system development in a population protected from and in those at risk for allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases.}

    abstract = {Background Postpartum contraception prevents unintended pregnancies and short interpregnancy intervals. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) collects population-based data on postpartum contraception nonuse and reasons for not using postpartum contraception. In addition to quantitative questions, PRAMS collects open-text responses that are typically left unused by secondary quantitative analyses. However, abundant preexisting open-text data can serve as a resource for improving quantitative measurement accuracy and qualitatively uncovering unexpected responses. We used PRAMS survey questions to explore unprompted reasons for not using postpartum contraception and offer insight into the validity of categorical responses.   Methods and findings We used 31,208 categorical 2012 PRAMS survey responses from postpartum women in the US to calculate original prevalences of postpartum contraception use and nonuse and reasons for contraception nonuse. A content analysis of open-text responses systematically recoded data to mitigate survey bias and ensure consistency, resulting in adjusted prevalence calculations and identification of other nonuse themes. Recoded contraception nonuse slightly differed from original reports (21.5% versus 19.4%). Both calculations showed that many respondents reporting nonuse may be at a low risk for pregnancy due to factors like tubal ligation or abstinence. Most frequent nonuse reasons were not wanting to use birth control (27.1%) and side effect concerns (25.0%). Other open-text responses showed common themes of infertility, and breastfeeding as contraception. Comparing quantitative and qualitative responses revealed contradicting information, suggesting respondent misinterpretation and confusion surrounding the term “pregnancy prevention.” Though this analysis may be limited by manual coding error and researcher biases, we avoided coding exhaustion via 1-hour coding periods and validated reliability through intercoder kappa scores.   Conclusions In this study, we observed that respondents reporting contraception nonuse often described other methods of pregnancy prevention and contraception barriers that were not included in categorical response options. Open-text responses shed light on a more comprehensive list of pregnancy prevention methods and nonuse options. Our findings contribute to survey questions that can lead to more accurate depiction of postpartum contraceptive behavior. Additionally, future use of these qualitative methods may be used to improve other health behavior survey development and resulting data.},

    abstract = { Since 2015, Mount Sinai HIV/HCV Center of Excellence has implemented two-day HIV and HCV preceptorships for New York State health care. Participants assessed their knowledge of and confidence to perform 13 HIV or 10 HCV prevention- and treatment-related skills, measured on a 4-point Likert scale from “not at all” to “very” knowledgeable/confident at baseline, exit survey, and a recent evaluation. Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests determined mean differences at all three time points. Between baseline to exit assessment and baseline to evaluation assessment, HIV and HCV preceptorship attendees reported significant increases in knowledge for five HIV and three HCV components and confidence for two HIV and three HCV tasks (p < .05), respectively. The preceptorship significantly and positively impacted short-term and long-term knowledge and confidence around HCV and HIV clinical skills. The implementation of HIV and HCV preceptorship programs may increase HIV and HCV treatment and prevention service efficacy within key population areas. }

    abstract = { The relationship between democracy, freedom, and economic development has a multidisciplinary and diverse literature without a settled or concrete answer. Studies that attempt to validate this relationship have a cacophony of diametrically opposed narratives with a degree of dissonance that does not always articulate a complete understanding of the issue. This study attempts to contribute to the existing complex and ever-changing literature by empirically estimating whether democracy, personal and economic freedom affect economic growth. This paper empirically investigates 115 countries over the period 2006–2018 using panel regressions and found that the quality of democracy was significant in explaining the per capita income growth dynamics of a country. Economic freedom also has a statistically significant and positive relationship with per capita income progression. Personal freedom, on the other hand, is detrimental to growth in countries that have low levels of freedom but acts as a catalyst for growth when a society has reached a mature level of personal freedom. Other factors related to development entrapment such as income inequality, unemployment, and urbanization also have a significant impact on economic progression. In line with historical consensus, countries institutionally insulated from democracy fare worse economically than their democratic counterparts. }

While judicial independence is positively and robustly related to personal freedom in all its forms, electoral democracy displays a robust, positive relationship with only two out of seven types of personal freedom (freedom of association, assembly and civil society; freedom of expression and information). Interaction terms and more refined indicators of the political system reveal that countries without elections or with only one political party benefit more from judicial independence than both democracies and multi-party systems without free elections.},
